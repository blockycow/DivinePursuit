   Say(1, "Haya Ji", "Alright Freya, let's go to our first class. It's a magical history class, and I think you'll find it very interesting.")
   Say(3, "Freya" , "I'm excited to learn more about the supernatural world.")
   Say(4, "Nar" , "As they walk to the classroom, Haya Ji points out various areas of the school and gives Freya a brief history of each one. They arrive at the classroom and take their seats.")
   Say(1, "Haya Ji","This is Professor Moriarty, he's one of the best magical historians in the world. Today we will be discussing the history of the Fae and their role in the supernatural world")
   Say(3, "Freya" , "This is fascinating, I never knew the Fae had such an important role in history.")
   Say(1, "Haya Ji","Yes, they have played a significant part in shaping the supernatural world as we know it. They have always been powerful beings, but their influence has waned in recent years.")
   Say(4, "Nar" , "Professor Moriarty goes on to discuss the various factions of the Fae and their alliances with other supernatural beings throughout history. Freya takes detailed notes and actively participates in the class discussion.")
   Say(3, "Freya", "I had no idea the Fae were so complex, I can't wait to learn more.")
   Say(1, "Haya Ji",  "That's just the beginning, Freya. You'll learn many more interesting things during your stay here.")
	  
	Say(4, "Nar" , " Freya and Haya ji go to the next class where Haya Ji shows Freya a traditional game of Daruma Otoshi and the other students Stan and Medusa joins them.")
